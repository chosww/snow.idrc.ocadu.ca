										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When writing keep content concise and clear</strong></h3>



<p>Consider <a href="/accessible-media-and-documents/text-simplification-guidlines/">text simplification guidelines</a>. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Include alt text for all images</strong>&#8230;</h3>



<p><strong>&#8230;including photos, drawings, charts and diagrams such as infographics.</strong> Alt text, the first principle of accessibility, is not a picture caption but rather a written equivalent to image content. If an image or series of images in any form of content has meaningful content it must have accompanying alternate text. Learn more about what <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/">alt text</a> [external link] is and how to <a href="https://www.ami.ca/category/business-and-technology-ami-digital-exclusives/media/ami-tech-tips-how-to-add-alt-text-to">apply alt text to a Word document</a> [external link].</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Check that the video you want to use has captions or described video</strong></h3>



<p>Some platforms, like Youtube, have auto captioning that can be turned on if a video doesn’t have its own captioning. Be aware that automated captioning can stumble on some spoken words or pronunciations and offer incorrect and sometimes inappropriate interpretations, so make sure you review the captioning before sharing. Having a separate digital transcript of the video content can be helpful for clarity as well as for <a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-display/screen-readers/">screenreaders</a>, <a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-display/refreshable-braille-display/">braille displays</a>, and learners who retain meaning by reading as well as listening. Audio recordings can also be made more accessible and inclusive by having a digital transcript available.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sometimes barriers are created by the digital interface </strong>(what sits between learner and material) or the technology delivering the material (software and platforms)</h3>



<p>There are some tools that can be added to a website or browser to increase learner accessibility options. For example, UIO (user interface options) or Learner Options can be added to a website or browser to give users the ability to customize a site by applying multiple settings such as page contrast, font style, and simplified view. See the demo <a href="https://build.fluidproject.org/infusion/demos/prefsFramework/">here</a> and access the beta chrome version <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ui-options-plus-uio%20/okenndailhmikjjfcnmolpaefecbpaek">here</a>.</p>



<p>Good interfaces should be easy to use and easy to build. Infusion takes the pain out of developing accessible, high performance, clean and nimble front-ends for applications that want to do more. The approach is to leave you in control—it&#8217;s your interface, using your markup, your way. Find out more at the <a href="https://fluidproject.org/infusion.html">Fluid Project</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use metadata to provide information about what needs a resource can accommodate</strong></h3>



<p>Metadata supporting personalization is moving gradually from a container/record-based approach to a flatter data model. This supports the use of mash-ups, media, and services that can be personalized, matched to individual requirements and delivered to the current context, independent of the device being used e.g. HD television, desktop computer, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or some other device. Consider using the <a href="https://handbook.floeproject.org/AccessForAll.html">AccessForAll</a> metadata. AccessForAll includes a standard way to describe a user&#8217;s needs and preferences. AccessForAll accessibility promotes an inclusive user experience by enabling the matching of the characteristics of resources to the needs and preferences of individual users. In circumstances where resources might not be suitable for all users, it enables the discovery of other appropriate resources. AccessForAll metadata is typically recorded in a metadata record separate from the resource itself. <a href="https://handbook.floeproject.org/SchemaOrgAccessibilityProperties.html">Schema.org</a>, which defines microdata properties that can be embedded directly into web resources, has incorporated several accessibility properties based on the AccessForAll metadata. This allows search engines such as Google, Yahoo, etc. to improve search results by not only matching search terms but also filter results based on the learner&#8217;s expressed needs and preferences.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Provide accessibility and inclusion information</strong></h3>



<p>By being transparent about the accessibility of your content people can decide if it is right for them or they may choose to build on the OER with further accessibility and inclusion. </p>



<p>A website should include an accessibility statement. Statements should contain at least the following:</p>



<ul><li>A commitment to accessibility for people with disabilities</li><li>The accessibility standard applied, such as WCAG 2.1</li><li>Contact information in case users encounter problems</li><li>Any known limitations, to avoid the frustration of your users</li><li>Measures taken by your organization to ensure accessibility</li><li>Technical prerequisites, such as supported web browsers</li><li>Environments in which the content has been tested to work</li><li>References to applicable national or local laws and policies</li><li>Find out more at the Web Accessibility Initiative page <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/">Developing an Accessibility Statement</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested in exploring more? You might find it valuable to also explore different Windows built-in <a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-control/windows-operating-system-os-accessibility/">alternative control</a> and <a href="/assistive-technology-2/augmentative-processing/windows-augmentative-processing-features/">augmentative processing features</a>, as some of these may make changes to how information is displayed. </span></p>
<h2><b>Features that change the way you get visual information </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audio descriptions – describes what’s happening in videos.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braille displays compatibility – in newer versions of Windows, Narrator is compatible with a number of different </span><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-display/refreshable-braille-display/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braille displays </span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Background images – turns off background images that are overlapping with the content to help make the screen easier to view. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colour or size or features of the mouse pointer – make the pointer larger, change the colour to make it easier to view, or add trails or a flashing sonar locator to help avoid losing the pointer. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cursor blink rate – change the blinking rate or fully turn off the blinking cursor. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edge e-book reader – adjust the text spacing and have text read aloud for purchased or downloaded e-pub books in the Edge Browser. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fonts – try out different system fonts to find out if one is easier to read (e.g. “Fluent Fonts” can be downloaded from Microsoft)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Contrast – can benefit those who have difficulty viewing the screen. This feature allows heightened screen contrast making the text, icons and images easier to view.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnifier – a basic </span><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-display/screen-magnifiers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">screen magnifier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that enlarges information the screen in order to view the screen more easily.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narrator – a basic </span><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-display/screen-readers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">screen reader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that reads text and program information in most Microsoft products, but may have some functionality in non-Microsoft programs. This feature can benefit those with print disabilities or those who prefer to hear information rather than see it. Narrator can be controlled by a keyboard or can follow the mouse pointer. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notification timing – increase the length of time notifications pop up to give you more time to respond or read the notification. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalization – adjust the colours and display of different items on the screen to meet your needs (e.g. remove the desktop image to make icon labels easier to read). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading View – switch into reading view on most web pages that have an article or main content to eliminate the extra ads, links, and other distracting information on the webpage.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On some touchscreen computers, if you touch the screen, the cursor will temporarily have a circle underneath it to show you where it is while you are moving it (e.g., using the arrow keys) until you start typing. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Features that change the way you get auditory information</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono Audio – turn stereo audio to mono audio to have auditory information come out only one speaker/channel.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skype Translator and video calling – video calls provide additional communication cues that can help facilitate understanding (e.g. sign language, lip reading, facial expressions, body language, hand gestures). Translator translates voice to text or text to voice to assist with communication on calls.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Text captions for spoken dialog – allows you to enable text captions for spoken dialog.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual notifications to sound – this setting allows you to receive notifications visually rather than audibly</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Features that change how you navigate (and impacts display)</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cortana – Cortana is a digital personal assistant available in more recent versions of Windows. Cortana can perform tasks for you and read information aloud (e.g. read you reminders and appointment details). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headings and the Navigation Pane – when using Word, use the different Heading Styles to organize your reports and documents. The Navigation Pane can then be used to provide a table of contents for easier visual navigation between sections. Headings are also recognized by certain screen readers for additional navigation options. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyboard Shortcuts – combinations of different keys perform different actions on the computer that can eliminate or reduce the need to use a pointer (e.g. ALT-F4, CTRL-W, and/or ESCAPE will close different programs or tabs within Windows to reduce the need to move your mouse to the “X” button and click to close). A list of Windows keyboard shortcuts can be found on the Windows Accessibility page. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ribbon and Quick Access – customize the Ribbon and Quick Access Toolbar to organize where different functions are on the screen. Make ribbon functions larger by creating a new tab, using fewer functions on that tab, and/or user groups and group names to space out the icons.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speech Recognition – allows the user to use their voice to interact with the computer, reducing the use of the mouse pointer and keyboard. Read </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more about <a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-control/voice-recognition-speech-to-text-software-2/">voice recognition</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spelling and Grammar – use Spelling and Grammar functions to proofread documents and reduce the number of mistakes that you might miss when editing visually.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Where to adjust the built-in features </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these features are found on the different versions of Windows (e.g. Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, and further back). However, there may be some differences in what features you have on your version of Windows, and there may be some slight differences in how each function works or where it can be found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using Windows 7 or older versions of Windows, most of these features can be found in the Control Panel, either under Ease of Access, Display, Mouse, Keyboard, Taskbar and Navigation. If you are using Windows 10 or 8.1, these features are found spread out between the older Control Panel (similar sections as above) and the newer Settings, either under Ease of Access, Time &amp; Language (Speech), and Personalization (Background, Colours, Themes, Start, Taskbar). Others might be found within specific programs (e.g. individual Office programs to customize the ribbon). While the newer versions of Windows have added new features, not all options can be adjusted in the Settings and you may have to still explore the Control Panel to make certain changes. Office 365, the most recent version of Microsoft Office, may also have features discussed above or new accessibility features to test out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want Windows to suggest some features that you might like based on your needs, you can “get recommendations to make your computer easier to use.” Find this link in the Control Panel under Ease of Access Center. </span></p>
<h2><b>Keeping up to date with accessibility on windows</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology is constantly changing, so keep an eye out for new features that could be beneficial for your or your students. Check out the </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/windows"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows Accessibility Page </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for up-to-date information about Windows accessibility features. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that everyone is unique and different features and settings may be used for a different purpose than they were designed. Explore the different settings in your Windows operating system and the software applications you use – you may end up finding additional tools or features that adapt how you receive information from your computer. And if you find something new and cool, </span><a href="https://snow.idrc.ocad.ca/contact"><span style="font-weight: 400;">send us your idea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we’ll review it to see if it fits on the SNOW website or our social media pages!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refreshable braille displays are electronic devices that are used to read text tactually that is typically displayed visually on a computer monitor or mobile device or tablet. The device is connected to the computer or device by a serial cable, USB cable or via Bluetooth and produces braille output on the braille display (small plastic or metal pins that move up and down to display the braille characters).</span></p>
<p><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-display/screen-readers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screen reading software</span></a> is needed for the user to have access to any information on the screen. Braille displays vary in terms of how many cells are available. The numbers after the name of a refreshable <span style="font-weight: 400;">braille</span> display indicates the number of <span style="font-weight: 400;">braille</span> cells active; 80 cells would give the computer user one line of information on the computer screen; 40 and 65 would give partial lines. Some portable<a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-control/notetakers-and-non-display-based-personal-digital-assistant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> note takers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have refreshable braille can be used as a refreshable braille display for a computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many current braille displays also have a braille keyboard so the device can be used for both reading text and creating text. Some braille displays also now have basic note-taking capabilities for taking notes on the go. </span></p>
<h2><b>Questions to consider when choosing a refreshable </b>b<b>raille display</b></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Features </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it have a braille keyboard? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it have basic note taking functions, so that it could be used without a computer to take notes? If yes, can you customize the speech feedback? (e.g., speech, pitch, volume, verbosity, language) and are headphones needed?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many braille cells are active on the display?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there multiple rows available on the display? Multi-line braille displays/tablets are an emerging technology that may be explored as an option. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it have extra keys that can be programmed with additional commands?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compatibility</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it compatible with your screen reader and operating system?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have the right connections, adaptors, or wireless support (e.g., Bluetooth, wifi) to connect? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are the documents you create able to be easily saved in a format that can be shared or opened by others?</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usability</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the physical layout of the keyboard and buttons? Do the buttons allow smooth and comfortable navigation without awkward movement?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are the buttons easy to tell apart (e.g., different sizes, tactile labels, different enough positions?)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How easy it is to take with you if portability is required? (e.g., size, weight, carrying case, battery length if applicable)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is its power source? (e.g., Do you need to have a wall outlet available? Is it USB powered?)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the warranty available for the technology? How are repairs handled? (e.g., is there someone in your area?)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will you get support if you need it? (e.g., a technician in the school, a local vendor, by telephone, by email, remote access, etc.)</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Office of Literacy and Essential Skills has defined 9 skills needed for work, learning and everyday living. Computer use is named as one of the skills required that provides the foundation for learning all other skills.  </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Students use computers for online researching, completing homework and projects, writing essays and assignments, etc.  Students with disabilities often have difficulties using the computer due to limitations in vision, hearing, mobility, and/or cognition. This section will highlight various high and low technologies that can assist with computer use.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>High technology to support computer use</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The following list of high technology can assist students who may not be able to use a standard computer setup.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s2"><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-control/on-screen-keyboard/"><strong>On-screen keyboard</strong> </a></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An onscreen (or virtual) keyboard generally appears on the same display used for programs and will remain permanently visible. The keyboard can then be accessed using the computers’ pointer device. This may be by using a standard mouse, or accessing it through the use of<a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-control/alternative-mouse-systems/"><span class="s3"> alternative mouse device</span></a> or <a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-control/switches/"><span class="s3">switches</span></a>.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s2"><a href="/?s=refreshable+braille+displays">Refreshable Braille Displays </a></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Refreshable Braille displays are electronic devices that are used to read text tactually that is typically displayed visually on a computer monitor. They are often use by individuals with visual impairments or those who are deaf-blind.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s2"><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-display/screen-magnifiers/">Screen magnifiers </a></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Screen magnification software is used by individuals with visual impairments to access information on a computers screen. The software enlarges any information on the screen including text, icons and graphics by pre-determined incremental factor, for example, 1.5x magnification, 2 x magnifications, 3 x magnifications, etc.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s2"><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-display/screen-readers/">Screen reader </a></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A Screen Reader, commonly used name for Voice Output Technology, is used by individuals who experience difficulty reading the standard text displayed on screen, for example, individuals who are visually impaired or blind. Screen readers produce synthesized speech output for text displayed on the computer screen, as well as for keystrokes entered on the keyboard.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s2"><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-control/voice-recognition-speech-to-text-software-2/">Voice recognition</a></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Voice recognition software (also known as speech to text software) allows an individual to use their voice instead of typing on a keyboard.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Low technology to support computer use</b></span></h2>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s2"><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-control/alternative-keyboards/">Alternative keyboards </a></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Often technology is not designed with the full diversity of users in mind and therefore alternative keyboard layouts allow people who experience difficulty accessing conventional keyboard designs to use computers.</span></p>
<h3 class="p6"><span class="s2"><a href="http://snow.idrc.ocad.ca/node/93">Alternative mouse systems</a></span></h3>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Alternative pointing devices are used to replace the mouse. This may include the use of trackballs, joysticks, trackpads, switches, etc.</span></p>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Ergonomic equipment</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The set up of your computer workstation can directly affect your ability to work at your computer. The following ergonomic equipment can help:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Glare filter<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Monitor arm<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Wrist rest<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Ergonomic chair<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Keyboard tray<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Foot rests<br />
</span></li>
<li class="li7"><span class="s1">Height adjustable desks<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Operating System Accessibility</b></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Your computer may have some built-in accessibility features that may make it easier for you to use. Find out more about your <a href="/assistive-technology-2/operating-system-accessibility/"><span class="s3">Operating System Accessibility</span></a> features here.</span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s2"><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-control/switches/">Switches</a></span></h3>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Switches are a common solution for users with mobility disabilities who need to use computers or other electronic devices, but have difficulty with the physical interface based on its&#8217; design.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Resources</b></span></h2>
<p class="p2"><span class="s5"><a href="http://www.esdc.gc.ca/en/essential_skills/index.page">Office of Literacy and Essential Skills (OLES)</a></span><span class="s1"> is a Canadian organization focused on improving the literacy and essential skills of adult Canadians. OLES provide expertise, project funding, and a wide range of learning tools and other resources.</span></p>

<p>We are half way through 2015, and schools boards across North America are entrenched with the lightest, fastest, long-lasting battery powered super computers the world has ever seen: tablets. With 1:1 ratios, class sets, carts, BYOD (“bring your own device”), and even that coveted single school tablet being passed around, schools are challenged with the updating, maintenance, cleaning, charging, and overall understanding of how to use these devices in the most efficient and effective manner for the students involved.</p>
<p>With so many questions emerging (about settings, gestures or other “how do I/can we…” questions) from our colleagues, IT contacts and students, you would think that there would be more rumblings about the set of features that are frequently untouched and yet irreplaceable for some users: the Accessibility Menu. For quite a while, it was almost daily that I would get a request to share my favorite app for a certain exceptionality. It was not uncommon that I would be asked for my “top 5 autism apps,” “my top 5 blind low vision apps,” or something like “what is your favorite app for text to speech” etc. I started calling the various app stores the “Last Resort Store” a few years back in an effort to get staff to consciously investigate the device from the inside out, before going to Google or an app store.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="http://www.snow.idrc.ocad.ca/sites/www.snow.idrc.ocad.ca/files/accessibility%20menus.jpg" alt="screen shot of accessibility menus for iOS, Windows, and Android" width="500" height="307" /></p>
<p><strong>iOS 8.3, Windows 8.1 and Android 5.2 Accessibility Menus. Don’t let size fool you however, more does not necessarily mean better.</strong></p>
<h2>Tablet Accessibility</h2>
<p>It could very easily be argued that more research and development money and thought goes into an Apple, Android or Windows tablet for the 1% of the market who requires a feature on the accessibility menu, than for the 99% of users who do not need it or know it exists. The marketing and commercialization of the devices does not tailor specifically to users of all abilities. One look at Accessibility Menus on the three leading brands of mobile operating systems though, reveals the incredible resources available to every user, out of the box, and the best part, they are all free.</p>
<p>The term <em>assistive technology </em>is no longer only meaning add-ons to a standard computer or laptop. Although some set-ups may still require specialized technology, for many, it is no longer a $10,000 special order from a specialty company, and there are no discs to install and, for the most part, no software to download. And even for those still requiring 3rd party devices and software, the built-in accessibility still makes the overall set-up more accessible, less costly, or easier to set-up. The market has shifted and continues to shift in incredible ways every day. Accessibility features are not an afterthought or a 3rd party venture anymore. We are starting to see them everywhere – built in and, best of all, FREE.</p>
<p>Before you Google for an app, try Googling “iOS, Android or Windows Accessibility.” Each company has a dedicated website to help users and support staff understand the key features built into the device. The accessibility websites assist people in truly taking advantage of the softwares’ incredible power to engage personally and communicate with the world.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="http://www.snow.idrc.ocad.ca/sites/www.snow.idrc.ocad.ca/files/google%20searches.jpg" alt="screen shot of accessibility websites for Android, iOS, and Windows" width="500" height="61" /></p>
<p><strong>A “Google” search worth doing is finding the respective mobile giants “Accessibility Website” for tutorials, tips and tricks</strong></p>
<h2>Accessibility Features Overview</h2>
<p>In an effort to promote the key features of all three operating systems, I created a chart that outlines the 12 most critical accessibility features in my opinion. Paired with each features is a basic summary of the pros and cons of each one. As you will see, there are some amazing features embedded into all three platforms. There are Windows features I would love to see in iOS, Android features that would make both competing platforms more accessible and undoubtedly, features in iOS that should be completely universal on all devices.</p>

<p>What I discovered in my research was not that one company was better than another or that one tablet was superior, but rather that the state of accessibility is very bitter-sweet. However, I suppose the term, “sweet-bitter” is more appropriate, as the current state of mobile accessibility comes with far more pros than cons. The take away on the bitter end for me was that what I once saw as an unselfish and humbling dedication to accessibility for all users by the three competing companies appeared more to be that these features were emerging as just as much of a business decision as any other. The idea that developing accessibility as a proprietary feature of their respective operating systems contradicts the basic goal of accessibility features. When companies patent gestures, code and interface options that directly impact a user’s ability to access the device, they build yet another barrier to access across the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<hr />
<p>At what point will accessibility reach its truest form of access with a standard set of features across all devices, regardless of price point, size and operating system?</p>
<hr />
</blockquote>
<p>In the evolution of accessibility, an endorsement of features should be universal across all platforms. I would like to see at least a small set of features coded and available to every user regardless of brand or price point. I understand the business model and encourage the companies to continue to craft and design their products to compete with each other on a number of levels. In some cases, even competing on some extremely unique accessibility options could further the way users interact with their devices. However, I challenge them to unite with others and remove barriers to access for niche pockets of the market. So many individuals’ lives can literally be transformed with the aid of a mobile, accessible device without the fear of cost difference, compatibility, and re-learning a system of features for every new task. Imagine picking up a tablet and having a universal accessibility shortcut to a screen reader, native accessibility gestures across all devices or even something as simple as text size and contrast options universally embedded.</p>
<p>Please use the charts above to begin, refine or advance upon your journey in mobile accessibility as a means to choose the right tool for the student. If you have little choice with regards to what tools your students have access too, I hope this chart can serve as either a point of conversation with different departments or as a BYOD starting point if students are coming to school with their own devices</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Refreshable Braille Displays are electronic devices that are used to read text tactually that is typically displayed visually on a computer monitor or mobile device/tablet. The device is connected to the computer or device by a serial cable, USB cable or via blue tooth and produces Braille output on the Braille display (small plastic or metal pins that move up and down to display the Braille characters).</p>
<p>A INSERTLINKLATER <a href="http://www.snow.idrc.ocad.ca/content/screen-readers-and-talking-browsers">screen reading software</a> is needed for the user to have access to any information on the screen. Braille displays vary in terms of how many cells are available. The numbers after the name of a refreshable Braille display indicates the number of Braille cells active; 80 cells would give the computer user one line of information on the computer screen; 40 and 65 would give partial lines.  Some INSERTLINKLATER <a href="http://www.snow.idrc.ocad.ca/node/91">portable note takers</a> that have refreshable Braille can be used as a refreshable Braille display for a computer.</p>
<p>Many current Braille displays also have a Braille keyboard so the device can be used for both reading text and creating text. Some Braille displays also now have basic notetaking capabilities for taking notes on the go.</p>
<p><strong>Points to Ponder</strong>: <strong>Questions to consider when choosing a refreshable Braille display</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Features
<ul>
<li>Does it have a Braille keyboard?</li>
<li>Does it have basic notetaking functions, so that it could be used without a computer to take notes? If yes, can you customize the speech feedback? (e.g., speech, pitch, volume, verbosity, language) and are headphones needed?</li>
<li>How many Braille cells are active on the display?</li>
<li>Are there multiple rows available on the display? Multi-line Braille displays/tablets are an emerging technology that may be explored as an option.</li>
<li>Does it have extra keys that can be programmed with additional commands?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compatibility
<ul>
<li>Is it compatible with your screen reader and operating system?</li>
<li>Do you have the right connections, adaptors, or wireless support (e.g., Bluetooth, wifi) to connect?</li>
<li>Are the documents you create able to be easily saved in a format that can be shared or opened by others?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usability
<ul>
<li>What is the physical layout of the keyboard and buttons? Do the buttons allow smooth and comfortable navigation without awkward movement?</li>
<li>Are the buttons easy to tell apart (e.g., different sizes, tactile labels, different enough positions?)</li>
<li>How easy it is to take with you if portability is required? (e.g., size, weight, carrying case, battery length if applicable)</li>
<li>What is its power source? (e.g., Do you need to have a wall outlet available? Is it USB powered?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Support
<ul>
<li>What is the warranty available for the technology? How are repairs handled? (e.g., is there someone in your area?)</li>
<li>How will you get support if you need it? (e.g., a technician in the school, a local vendor, by telephone, by email, remote access, etc.)</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Braille?</h2>
<p>Braille is a tactile system of raised dots that enables students with low vision or blindness to access information by touch. The pattern of raised dots is arranged in cells of up to six dots, creating a total of 63 different combinations possible. Each cell represents an alphabet letter, numeral or punctuation mark. Some frequently used words and letter combinations also have their own single cell patterns.</p>
<h2>Why Learn Braille?</h2>
<p>Braille can be the building block for language skills and a way to teach spelling, grammar, and punctuations to students with vision loss or who are deaf-blind. Not only do braille codes represent alphabets, they also denote numbers, symbols, music, and mathematical notations, enabling students to learn about different subjects in school. Braille books are available in all subject areas, ranging from modern fiction to mathematics, music, and law. As with printed text, Braille makes it possible for students to take notes in class, study educational material, read watches, and label personal belongings, etc.</p>
<p>In order to enjoy intellectual freedom, personal security, and equal opportunities when they grow up, students need to be literate—to read, write, and count. Although only a relatively small percentage of people with visual impairments or blindness use braille (around 10%), it is essential that schools are able to provide students options with how they wish to access their information. Other alternative formats such as audio and speech generating software on computers provides access to written materials, but they fail to give new readers the basic literacy skills they need to read and write for themselves.</p>
<h2>Types of Braille</h2>
<p>There are two different grades of braille:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade 1 (uncontracted) braille consists of the 26 standard letters of the alphabet and punctuation. Many learners start by studying the basic dot combinations for the letters of the alphabet, the main punctuation symbols, and the numbering system. It is suitable for students who are first starting to read braille, or young children who are learning spelling of words. This type of braille is also useful for labeling notebooks for different subjects, or accessing small portions of text in a picture book. Research has shown that children who learn grade 1 braille benefit from early success and helps with learning grade 2 braille later on.</li>
<li>Grade 2 (contracted) braille uses the same 26 letters of the alphabet, punctuation, and numbers as grade 1 braille, with the addition of shorthand that combines groups of letters into one braille cell. Because a braille page cannot fit as much text as a standard printed page, the use a contracted version of braille reduces the size of braille documents by 25 per cent and allows for more rapid reading and writing. Almost all books and magazines are written and printed in grade 2 braille; therefore, it is encouraged for students who prefer to read large volumes of text in braille to learn the contracted version.</li>
<li>Unified English Braille (UEB) is a set of rules and codes for braille symbols that is shared across most English speaking countries. In the past, there were different braille rules and codes for different countries or groups of countries.</li>
<li>Other types of braille have been created for different purposes. For example, Nemeth Braille was created for mathematical and scientific notation, and has partially been included into UEB. Music Braille is another type of braille that is used for musical notation for those reading or writing music in braille.</li>

<p><a href="/resources/one-is-fun/">One Is Fun</a> is a useful guide for educators to introduce braille to students of all ages and abilities, from preschool to primary grades, to secondary school students or adults who are starting to learn braille. This guide includes considerations for students with learning disabilities or English as a second language, activities for preschool students with or without multiple disabilities, and detailed guides for braille phonics programs. Both educators and parents can benefit from this guide in obtaining valuable resources and understanding the complexities different learners face when learning braille.</p>
<h2>Low and High Technology for Reading and Writing Braille</h2>
<p>Modern technology has made various useful tools for people who read and write braille. There are some devices that produce books or handouts in Braille and others that enable students to read information on computers and from the Internet. Some devices are simple and inexpensive while others are very complicated.</p>
<h3>Reading Braille</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-display/refreshable-braille-display/">Refreshable braille display</a> – Refreshable braille displays are electronic devices used to display braille characters, and read tactually by means of raising dots through holes on a braille display. The device is connected to a computer, tablet, or smartphone phone, enabling students using computers to “read” the content off the screen through outputs on the braille display. In 2017, refreshable braille tablets are entering the market; to date, these use different refreshable dot technology with multiple lines and are paired together with mobile devices as the operating system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-display/braille-embossers/">Braille embosser</a> – A braille embosser is a hardware device for “printing” a hardcopy document of text in braille. Braille translation software is required in order to translate word-processing text files into braille suitable for embossing on a braille printer.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are pros and cons to both types of braille formats (refreshable braille and paper braille), so it is important to consider these when working with a student learning or reading in braille. An article by Christian Coudert, the editor in chief of the Louis Braille, shares some general advantages and disadvantages of paper and refreshable braille (2015). For example, braille because it provides additional information (e.g. structure of a paragraph), which is especially key for new braille learners, whereas a refreshable braille display provides a compact device that can access many books and documents in braille (Coudert, 2015).</p>
<h3>Writing Braille</h3>
<ul>
<li>Perkins Brailler – The Perkins Brailler is a portable low-tech &#8220;braille typewriter&#8221; with keys corresponding to each of the six dots of the braille code. When pressed simultaneously in different combinations, students can create any characters of the braille code. Like a manual typewriter, it has two side knobs to advance paper through the machine and a carriage return lever above the keys. There are many models of the Perkins Brailler that suits the needs of different students. Features include: reduction of force required to press braille keys for students typing for longer periods of time or have decreased hand strength; enlarged spaces between dots on braille cells for people with tactile problems; and unimanual braillers enabling students to take notes with one hand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/assistive-technology-2/alternative-control/notetakers-and-non-display-based-personal-digital-assistant/">Non-display based PDA</a> – Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are handheld portable devices that act as organizers, note takers and/or communication devices. Non-display based PDAs were designed mainly for people with visual impairments who do not utilize touch screens, handwriting recognition, and miniature keyboards. They typically either have a braille chording keyboard or a QWERTY keyboard, and newer models also have touchscreens with software for a touch keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Slate and Stylus – The Slate and Stylus is a low-cost, highly portable low-tech writing tool. It is equivalent to the pencil and paper concept, enabling students with visual impairments to create braille notes. The slate is made from two panels that stabilizes the paper and the stylus is used to punch through the holes through one of the panel to create the braille dots. The slate comes in many sizes, from two-line to full-page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jot-a-Dot – The Jot-A-Dot is a low tech writing tool made of light weight plastic material that is small in size and portable. Braille is embossed through six keys entry onto note-sized paper. The Jot-A-Dot is useful for taking quick and short notes on the go. It is considered a brailler and has a similar typing set-up to a braille typewriter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dymo Braille Labeler – This tool is used to make quick braille labels. It is a wonderful tool for classroom teachers who have little to no knowledge about the braille code, but would like to label materials in the classroom or school. This portable and lightweight tool includes print letters that are viewed on a wheel. Simply spin the wheel to select the letter and press on the handle to emboss that letter onto the label.</li>

<h2>How Braille Relates to the AODA legislation</h2>
<p>Braille relates to the following sections of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) Integrated Accessibility Standards, specifically some of the following sections in the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/r11191#BK9">Information and Communication Standards</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/r11191#BK13">Accessible Formats and Communication Supports</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/r11191#BK18">Producers of Educational Training Material</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the Ontario public education system, the <a href="http://alternativeresources.ca/Aero/Public/WelcomePage.aspx">Alternate Education Resources of Ontario</a> service of the Provincial Schools Branch provides alternate formats like braille, which helps schools in meeting AODA requirements.</p>
<h3>AODA Significance</h3>
<ol>
<li>Braille is an alternative format used by persons who are blind or who have low vision to communicate and convey information. A Braille Embosser with the braille translation software are necessary technology required in order to create braille materials.</li>
<li>People interact, learn, and communicate in diverse ways. Learning opportunities are increased when flexible ways of engaging with learning materials are provided. Considering how people communicate is important for knowledge to be exchanged. Alternative formats take into account diverse ways of exchanging information.</li>
<li>The AODA legislates that educational institutions and their employees know how to produce accessible or conversion ready versions of textbooks and printed material. Educators, teachers, and staff are to learn about accessible program or course delivery and instruction and be knowledgeable at interacting and communicating with people with disabilities who may use alternate formats.</li>
</ol>
